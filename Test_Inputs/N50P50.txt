The coffee had a smooth texture, but the flavor was lacking any real depth. It felt like something was missing.
I liked the initial aroma, but the bitterness quickly took over. Not terrible, but not something I’d buy again.
It’s decent for a quick cup in the morning, but it doesn’t have the rich, bold flavor I usually go for.
The packaging looked great, and the beans smelled fresh, but the taste was surprisingly flat.
I tried it both black and with cream, and while it was okay, the bitter aftertaste lingered too long.
For the price, I was expecting something more enjoyable. It wasn’t bad, but I’ve had better at half the cost.
There were hints of chocolate and nuttiness, but they were subtle and quickly overpowered by a burnt taste.
It’s not the worst coffee I’ve had, but it certainly doesn’t stand out. Just your average grocery store brew.
I liked how smooth it was, but the acidity was a little too high for my preference.
The roast was darker than I anticipated, leaving a bitter and almost burnt aftertaste.
I had high hopes for this coffee based on the reviews, but it didn’t quite live up to the hype. The beans smelled promising, and the initial brew had a pleasant aroma. Unfortunately, the taste was one-dimensional. It lacked the complexity I expect from a premium coffee. I tried different brewing methods — drip, French press, and pour-over — but none brought out the rich notes that were advertised. It wasn’t terrible, just disappointingly mediocre.
This coffee was a surprise. The first few sips were enjoyable with some mild chocolate notes, but as it cooled, the bitterness became overpowering. I also noticed a slightly sour aftertaste that lingered unpleasantly. While I appreciated the initial smoothness, it just didn’t maintain its appeal. I might finish the bag since it wasn’t awful, but I won’t be repurchasing.
I really wanted to love this coffee, but it just wasn’t for me. It was too acidic, leaving a sharp, almost vinegary taste in my mouth. Even with added cream, the bitterness was hard to ignore. I typically enjoy a medium roast, but this one was darker than expected. The packaging was sleek and the aroma was promising, but unfortunately, the flavor didn’t live up to it.
It’s an okay choice for someone who likes a darker roast, but it was too harsh for my liking. I was hoping for a smooth and rich flavor, but it was overshadowed by a burnt, smoky taste. Even adding sugar didn’t help much. I could see it working well in espresso drinks, but as a simple black coffee, it wasn’t enjoyable.
The coffee was pretty good for the price, but not outstanding. It brewed well and had a mild flavor that wasn’t too overpowering. However, the body was a bit thin, and it lacked that bold punch I usually look for in a morning cup. If you prefer something light and easy to drink, this could be a decent choice, but if you want complex flavors, you might be disappointed.
The initial aroma when brewing was fantastic, but the actual taste didn’t deliver the same experience. It had a mild nuttiness that I enjoyed, but the bitterness crept in quickly. It wasn’t completely undrinkable, but it’s not something I would serve to guests. I might try blending it with another roast to balance the flavor.
This coffee had a smooth texture and a decent balance of flavors, but it was missing that wow factor. I noticed subtle hints of caramel, but they were too faint to really enjoy. The roast was a bit darker than I prefer, which left a slightly bitter finish. It’s drinkable, but I won’t go out of my way to get it again.
I thought the coffee was alright at first, but after a few cups, I started to notice an unpleasant aftertaste. It had a smoky flavor that lingered in a way I didn’t enjoy. The beans also seemed a bit oily, which might have contributed to the bitterness. I’ll finish the bag, but I doubt I’ll reorder.
This coffee had a bold, rich flavor, but it leaned too far into bitterness for my taste. I typically enjoy dark roasts, but this one lacked any sweetness to balance it out. The acidity was also higher than I expected, making it a bit harsh on the stomach. It’s not the worst I’ve had, but it’s not something I’ll reach for again.
I enjoyed the chocolatey notes in this coffee, but they were a bit too subtle. The roast was on the darker side, which brought out some bitterness that overwhelmed the other flavors. It wasn’t bad, but it lacked the complexity I was hoping for. It might work better in a latte or with sweetener.
There was a nice, nutty aroma when I opened the bag, but the flavor didn’t match up. The coffee was surprisingly weak, even when I adjusted my brewing method. I prefer a stronger, bolder cup, so this one just didn’t hit the mark. It might work for those who like a milder brew.
It’s not a terrible coffee, but it’s also not memorable. The flavor was middle-of-the-road, with no distinctive notes that stood out. It brewed smoothly and didn’t have much bitterness, but it also lacked depth. I’d probably choose something else next time.
The coffee was okay, but it tasted a little stale. I was hoping for something fresh and vibrant, but instead, it had a flat and lifeless flavor. The packaging claimed hints of caramel and cocoa, but I struggled to detect anything beyond a mild bitterness. It was drinkable, but I won’t be buying it again.
I expected this coffee to be bold and rich, but it was surprisingly weak. Even using a higher coffee-to-water ratio didn’t bring out much flavor. The beans were oily and had a slightly burnt smell, which carried over into the taste. While it wasn’t the worst I’ve had, it was definitely disappointing.
The flavor was decent, but it wasn’t as bold as I was hoping for. I enjoyed the subtle nutty notes, but the bitterness was a bit overwhelming by the end of the cup. I probably wouldn’t repurchase, but it might be fine for someone who prefers a darker roast.
I liked that the coffee had a strong, robust flavor, but it was slightly too acidic for my taste. It left a bit of a sour aftertaste, which I wasn’t a fan of. I tried adding cream and sugar, and that helped a little, but it still wasn’t the smooth cup I was hoping for.
This coffee was surprisingly smooth with a nice aroma, but it lacked any memorable flavor. The taste was mild and somewhat flat, without the rich notes I usually enjoy. It’s not a bad option if you just need a quick caffeine fix, but it’s not something I’d savor.
There was a slight burnt flavor that lingered, which made it hard to enjoy. I tried making it a few different ways, but even with milk and sugar, it didn’t quite work for me. It wasn’t completely undrinkable, but I wouldn’t buy it again.
This coffee wasn’t as fresh as I hoped. The aroma was dull, and the beans looked overly oily. The flavor was okay at best, but it had a lingering bitterness that was hard to ignore. It’s not the worst I’ve had, but definitely not a favorite.
