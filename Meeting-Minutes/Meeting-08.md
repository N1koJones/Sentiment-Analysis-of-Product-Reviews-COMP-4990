Getting ready to train the BERT model

Prof says:
- Needs to preprocess and clean the training data. 
- Needs to be tokenized (remove spaces)
- We can start working with the top 100 from the dataset we used.
- BERT is pre-trained


## Delivery of project
- Web application
- Input link / search term
- Analyze the data
- Present to user, either with key-words and or graphs.


End term notes:
- exe is able to be done for historical user experience.
- Strongly encouraged to put it web based for the end goal.
- Have a brief write up of the todo list and plan our roadmap.
- preprocessing, training, fine tuning, ui/ux, front end / back end.

UI:
- UI must be functional
- Usable to serve purpose of the user to be able to look up a product and gauge its sentimetnt.
- Can additionally show graphs or more depth

Damian's Notes:
-Clean gathered dataset (remove spaces, etc)
-Use default BERT and check results
-Fine tune BERT (or use Roberta) as needed
-Make it a webapp (NodeJS/Angular) (Good learning experience, better fit for modern use)
-Major keywords for +/-, keep it simple
-Click a dropdown list of products (optional)
-If Niko wants to make 2 different versions of this, he can go ahead
-Create 3-4 month roadmap (by next week preferably, up to 10 days)
-UI should be functional first, pretty is an afterthought
